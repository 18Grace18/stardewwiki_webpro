                        <h2>Eric Barone (developer)</h2>
                        also known by his alias ConcernedApe, is an American video game developer, video game designer, artist, composer, and musician. He is most notable for creating Stardew Valley.<br></br><br></br>

                        Barone began working on Stardew Valley in 2012 and released it in 2016. He was praised for creating the game entirely independently. He did everything from making the characters, writing the dialogue, creating the music, and animating every pixel. To this day Barone refuses to hire a team and prefers to work independently. <br></br><br></br>

                        Barone announced that he is working on several new games with at least one of them set to be in the world of Stardew Valley. Another game that he is working on is planned to be tied into the Stardew Valley universe. <br></br><br></br>
