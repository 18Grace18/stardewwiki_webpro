                Pelican Town is where the player moves to at the start of the game, located in Stardew Valley.<br></br> Pelican Town is where most of the villagers live, work, and socialize.<br></br><br></br>

                Lewis is the mayor of Pelican Town and has been for many years; he comments that he has not had competition for the role since first becoming mayor.<br></br><br></br>

                The northwest entrance to town connects to the Bus Stop and The Farm. The southwest passage connects to Cindersap Forest, which contains Marnie's Ranch, Leah's Cottage, and the Wizard's Tower. Directly south of town is The Beach. North of town connects to The Mountain, with Robin's carpenter shop, the mines, the Adventurer's Guild, the Railroad, and the Quarry.<br></br><br></br>

                Initially, there are weeds located near 2 Willow Lane, in the area behind 1 Willow Lane, behind JojaMart, and to the west of the Community Center, below the playground. These weeds will die during Winter, but will respawn at the start of each new year.<br></br>

            <p class="normalinf" > 
                The Beach is located to the south of Pelican Town. It is a valuable area for Fishing, being the only source for all saltwater Fish.<br></br>In addition, many shells and forageable items can be found washed up on the beach (especially during Summer 12-14).<br></br><br></br>

                During the Summer the Luau and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies festivals are held on the beach. <br></br>In Winter, the Night Market is held on the pier from the 15th to the 17th.<br></br>

                - On Spring 5, debris blocking the bridge north of the lake is cleared, providing acess to the Mines and the Adventurer's Guild.<br></br>
                - On Summer 3, an earthquake opens a pass north from the Mountain to the Railroad.<br></br>
                - The bridge leading to the Quarry at the east end of the map can be repaired <br></br>(by completing all Crafts Room Bundles, or purchased for 25,000g from Joja).<br></br>
                - The Glittering Boulder blocking the water flow west of the mine entrance can be removed <br></br>(by completing all Fish Tank Bundles, or purchased for 20,000g from Joja).<br></br>

                Cindersap Forest is a large exterior region found in the southwest part of Stardew Valley. <br></br>It has exits to the north into the Farm, to the east into Pelican Town, to the south into The Sewers, and to the northwest into the Secret Woods. Cindersap Forest is the only place where you can find Spring Onions.<br></br>

                Two festivals take place in Cindersap Forest: the Flower Dance on Spring 24, and the Festival of Ice on Winter 8.<br></br><br></br>

                At the start of the game, there are many twigs, rocks, and weeds throughout the forest. If cleaned up, the debris will reappear each Spring 1.<br></br>

                he Calico Desert is an exterior map region located far to the northwest of Pelican Town.<br></br> The weather here is always sunny (even if it is raining everywhere else in Stardew Valley), and the seasons are all the same.<br></br><br></br>

                The desert is inaccessible until the Bus at the Bus Stop has been repaired by completing the Vault bundles at the Community Center or by purchasing the Bus Repair for 40,000g from the Joja Community Development Form.<br></br><br></br>

                Once repaired, bus tickets can be purchased at the Bus Stop for 500g per round trip, as long as Pam is present <br></br>(10:00 am - 5:00 pm each day except for the 25th of Spring). <br></br>Warping is the only way to reach the Desert when Pam is not at work.<br></br> Pam will patiently wait by the Bus for the rest of the day (to 2:00 am even) to drive you back to Stardew Valley.<br></br> No in-game time passes during the bus ride to or from the desert.<br></br>
